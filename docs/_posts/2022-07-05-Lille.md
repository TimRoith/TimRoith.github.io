Today I presented our work on convergence rates for the Lipschitz learning problem at the [conference on calculus of variation](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/7044/) in Lille.

This is a joint work with Leon Bungert and Jeff Calder which is discussed in more detail in this [post](/paper/2021/11/25/UCR.html). 

# Impressions

This was my first time in Lille and I was impressed by the beauty of the city. Especially since my hotel room was directly next to the Saint Maurice Church.
