Here's an overview of some of my research projects and interests.

## Semi-Supervised Learning

## Supervised Learning

The projects on supervised learning that I did so far, manly involved neural networks. Below you can find a short overview.

### Sparse Neural Networks

For this project we used linearized Bregman iterations, in order to train sparse neural networks.

You can find the code for the project in our [repo](https://github.com/TimRoith/BregmanLearning). So far we have [two papers](/publications/) on this topic.

### Robust Neural Networks

Here, we tried to enforce Lipschitz continuity for neural networks, motivated by adversarial instabilities. The code for this project 
can be found [here](https://github.com/TimRoith/CLIP).
