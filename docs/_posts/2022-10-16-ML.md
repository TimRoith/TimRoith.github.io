This week I am visiting my colleague [Leon Bungert](https://sites.google.com/view/leon-bungert/) at the [Mittag-Leffler insitute](http://www.mittag-leffler.se/) 
in Stockholm. He is staying there for the program [Geometric Aspects of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations](http://www.mittag-leffler.se/langa-program/geometric-aspects-nonlinear-partial-differential-equations) 
and I am very happy to have the chance to visit him there.
