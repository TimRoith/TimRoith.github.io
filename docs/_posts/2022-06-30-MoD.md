Today I presented our work on convergence rates for the Lipschitz learning problem in our joint junior seminar. This seminar takes place within the network of the [MoD community](https://mod.fau.eu/members/).

I was presenting a joint work with Leon Bungert and Jeff Calder which is discussed in more detail in this [post](/paper/2021/11/25/UCR.html).
