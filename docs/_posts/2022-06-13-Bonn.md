Today I had the chance to present our work on convergence rates for the Lipschitz learning problem at the [HCM - Workshop Synergies between Data Science and PDE Analysis](https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/events/eventpages/2022/syn-2022/l).

I was presenting a joint work with Leon Bungert and Jeff Calder which is discussed in more detail in this [post](/paper/2021/11/25/UCR.html).

It was a great honor speaking about Lipschitz learning in the beautiful Lipschitz lecture Hall in Bonn.
During my stay I also got the chance to visit the grave of Felix Hausdorff and Rudolf Lipschitz together with some colleagues. Going there is a great experience and I can recommend every mathematician to pay their respects here.

The tombstone is not exactly easy to find but there is a rather old [website](http://www.w-volk.de/museum/grave15.htm) providing some rough details on where to find the spot.
