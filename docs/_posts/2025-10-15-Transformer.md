title:  "Bridging AI and Theory: Workshop on the Mathematics of Transformers at DESY"
---

At a recent workshop hosted by DESY, around 30 experts from across Europe came together to explore the theoretical foundations of transformers, the core architecture behind modern large language models. Organized by researchers from DESY, Helmholtz Imaging, and the University of Oxford, the event featured inspiring talks and a lively world cafÃ© discussion.
The positive response shows growing momentum in this young field. Stay tuned for a potential second edition!
