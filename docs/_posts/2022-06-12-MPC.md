## Mathematik für Physikstudierende C

In winter semester 21/22 me and Daniel Tenbrinck were responsible for the lecture "Mathematik für Physikstudierende C" at FAU. This lecture is the third part of the pure mathematics courses that physicist can attend at FAU. The topics include

* [ordinary differential equations](https://fau-ammn.github.io/MathPhysicsC/odestability/stabilitaetsanalyse.html)
* [stability of ordinary differential equations](https://fau-ammn.github.io/MathPhysicsC/odestability/stabilitaetsanalyse.html)
* [vector calculus](https://fau-ammn.github.io/MathPhysicsC/vektoranalysis/vektoranalysis.html)
* [differential forms](https://fau-ammn.github.io/MathPhysicsC/manifolds/manifolds.html)
* [measure and integration theory](https://fau-ammn.github.io/MathPhysicsC/masstheorie/intro_masstheorie.html)
* [complex calculus](https://fau-ammn.github.io/MathPhysicsC/complexanalysis/complexanalysis.html)

The lecture was given in german.

## Lecture Recordings

The lecture was given in a hybrid format, where the tutorials were taking place in person and the lecture itself was available via recordings online. The videos are available on [fau.tv](https://www.fau.tv/course/id/2691).

The first part of the lecture was given by Daniel Tenbrinck, the second half was given by myself.

## Online Lecture Notes

For this lecture we decided to try out an exciting new way to provide lecture notes, namely via [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). This framework allows us to write content very easily with Jupyter markdown and then host it via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The [sphinx-book-theme](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme) gives the whole a site a very structured and user-friendly look, as you can observe [here](https://fau-ammn.github.io/MathPhysicsC/intro.html).  You can also take a look at our [github repo](https://github.com/FAU-AMMN/MathPhysicsC).

### Hypothesis Plugin

An advantage of the online lecture note, is that we can place a hook for [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) which allows students to directly annotate the notes.

Alternatively one can of course also open an issue on github.

### LaTeX conversion and PDF Output

Sphinx provides an automatic conversion of the web pages to LaTeX. Unfortunately, I had to do a lot of manual coding to get this process running properly and it is still rather very fragile. However, in our current setup each building step automatically produces LaTeX files, which can then be used to obtain a PDF version of the script. Here, we employ the [fau-math-thesis](https://github.com/TimRoith/fau-math-thesis) template. A big downside of the current process, is that the numbering (of theorems, lemmas, etc.) is different for the online and the PDF version. This is of course very bad and I am trying to fix that soon.

If you are interested in our workflow for JupyterBook you can read mor about this [here](/jb-workflow/).
