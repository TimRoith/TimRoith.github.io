During my time at university, LaTeX was constantly following me around and helping me out. I tried to make 
everything easier by producing some templates that can be reused by me and others for various projects.

## fau-book

This template is suitable for theses and lecture notes. You can directly download the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/FAU-AMMN/fau-book) 
or take a look at the post on my website [here](/2022/08/29/Book/).
