During my time at university, LaTeX was constantly following me around and helping me out. I tried to make 
everything easier by producing some templates that can be reused by me and others for various projects.

## hi-beamer

## fau-beamer

A LaTeX beamer template according to the 2021 [style guide](https://www.intern.fau.de/kommunikation-marketing-und-corporate-identity/corporate-identity/) of [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de/). The given template allows you to create LaTeX presentations with the [beamer class](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en) in the corporate style of FAU. You can find the template [here](https://github.com/FAU-AMMN/fau-beamer).

## fau-book

This template is suitable for theses and lecture notes. You can directly download the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/FAU-AMMN/fau-book) 
or take a look at the post on my website [here](/2022/08/29/Book/).
