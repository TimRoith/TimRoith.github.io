Together with [Leon Bungert](https://sites.google.com/view/leon-bungert/news) and  [Jeff Calder](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~jwcalder/index.html) we published a preprint on
[Uniform Convergence Rates for Lipschitz Learning on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12370).

The code for the experiments can be found on our GitHub repository [LipschitzLearningRates](https://github.com/jwcalder/LipschitzLearningRates).

## Lecture on Lipschitz Learning Convergence Rate

During the workshop [Dynamics and Discretization: PDEs, Sampling, and Optimization](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/gmos2021-2) in October 2021 at the Simons Insitute Berkeley Jeff Calder gave a lecture about the subject. The video is available on YouTube.
