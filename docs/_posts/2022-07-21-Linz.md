Today I had the chance to present our work on a kernelized version of consensus based optimization at the [15th International Conference on Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods in Scientific Computing](https://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/events/conferences/mcqmc2022/).

This is a joint work with Leon Bungert and Philipp Wacker which is discussed in more detail in this [post](/projects/KCBO/).
