title:  "Girls in MINT"
---

Was very happy to give a talk for the ["MÃ¤dchen- und Technik 2021"-week](https://www.maedchen-technik.de/index.php?domain=gat) 
together with Daniel Tenbrinck. This event allows young girls to gain an insight into the academic world. 

We were giving an introduction to CT and performed some experiments with our beloved shadow tomograph.
