The paper on Bregman learning for sparse neural networks which I worked on together with [Leon Bungert](https://sites.google.com/view/leon-bungert/news), [Daniel Tenbrinck](https://www.math.fau.de/angewandte-mathematik-1/mitarbeiter/dr-daniel-tenbrinck/) and [Martin Burger](https://www.math.fau.de/angewandte-mathematik-1/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-martin-burger/) just got published in the [Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.org/).

You can find the published version [here](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0545/21-0545.pdf) and if you are interested in the code you can checkout our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TimRoith/BregmanLearning).
