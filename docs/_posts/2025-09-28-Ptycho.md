We put a preprint on the arXiv dealing with position-blind pytychography. Compared to the standard setup, here we ask ourselves how well the reconstruction problem can be solved, when the scan position are completely unknown. Furthermore, we explore how to leverage a powerful data-driven prior with a variational inference approach. This is joint work Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman. Part of this project was done during my DAAD funded research stay at Caltech, in Oktober 2024.

The preprint is available on the arXiv: [Position-Blind Ptychography: Viability of image reconstruction via data-driven variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25269).
