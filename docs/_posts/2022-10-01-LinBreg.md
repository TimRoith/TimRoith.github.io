categories: paper
---

I am very happy to announce that our paper on
[Bregman learning](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-0545.html) will be presented as a poster at [NeurIPS 22](https://nips.cc/). You can checkout the poster on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364946779_A_Bregman_Learning_Framework_for_Sparse_Neural_Networks_-_Training_Neural_Networks_via_Mirror_Descent) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/TimRoith/Bregman-Poster-NeurIPS22).

In order to create it I employed the LaTeX template that I created for FAU, see [here](https://github.com/FAU-AMMN/fau-beamer).

You can also look at a short 5 minute prestation, where I wrap up the paper [at slideslive](https://recorder-v3.slideslive.com/#/share?share=72696&s=d6a18c43-5484-4b9a-8d34-3c6f71b6c45d).
