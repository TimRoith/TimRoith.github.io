categories: paper

I will present the work on continuum limits of Lipschitz learning at the [FoCM 2023](https://focm2023.pages.math.cnrs.fr/) as a poster. You can find the poster [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371492002_Poster_Convergence_Rates_for_Lipschitz_Learning_on_Very_Sparse_Graphs). It summarizes the main results of the following papers I wrote together with Jeff Calder and Leon Bungert:

* [Continuum Limit of Lipschitz Learning on Graphs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09557-9)
* [Uniform convergence rates for Lipschitz learning on graphs](https://academic.oup.com/imajna/article-abstract/43/4/2445/6705556?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
* [Ratio convergence rates for Euclidean first-passage percolation: Applications to the graph infinity Laplacian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09023)
