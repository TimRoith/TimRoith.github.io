Today I had the chance to present our work about stochastic Bregman iterations at the [East Coastern Optimization Meeting (ECOM)](https://math.gmu.edu/~hantil/ECOM/2022/index.html).

You can find a recording of the talk [here](https://coursemedia.gmu.edu/media/East_Coast_Optimization_Meeting+%28ECOM%29+2022/1_96anyzvv).
