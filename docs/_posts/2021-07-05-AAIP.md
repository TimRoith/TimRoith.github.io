Happy to announce that I will be presenting our paper about [Bregman iterations](/publications/BregmanLearning/) at the [2nd Alps-Adriatic Inverse Problems Workshop](https://conference2.aau.at/event/62/) which is taking place at Klagenfurt during September 22-24, 2021. I am especially thrilled that my talk is scheduled to be live in Klagenfurt which marks the first in person event for me in a long time.
