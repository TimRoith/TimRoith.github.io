Today I was given the chance to present our work on convergence rates for the Lipschitz learning problem at the [GAMM Annual Meeting 2022](https://jahrestagung.gamm-ev.de/) in Aachen.

This is a joint work with Leon Bungert and Jeff Calder which is discussed in more detail in this [post](/paper/2021/11/25/UCR.html).
