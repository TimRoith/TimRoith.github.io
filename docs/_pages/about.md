I'm a PhD student in mathematics at the [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) and here I present some fun facts about me.

## Hobbies and Interests

<img src="/assets/img/TecoNCat.jpg" width="300" class="align-right"> 

I started studying mathematics at the FAU in 2015 and have been collecting interests and projects ever since. Some of these include numerics, PDEs, graphs, functional analysis and neural networks. Furthermore, I am also a hobby computer scientist and a wannabe nerd, for which I picked up an obsession with LaTeX. Outside of the university I like to run, lift metal of the floor and play football.

For an overview of some of the projects I am involved in you can visit the [Projects](/projects/) page on my site.

## I like [Kant](https://ctan.org/pkg/kantlipsum?lang=en)

As any dedicated reader can clearly see, the Ideal of practical reason is a representation
of, as far as I know, the things in themselves; as I have shown elsewhere, the phenomena
should only be used as a canon for our understanding.

The paralogisms of practical
reason are what first give rise to the architectonic of practical reason. As will easily be
shown in the next section, reason would thereby be made to contradict, in view of these
considerations, the Ideal of practical reason, yet the manifold depends on the phenomena.
Necessity depends on, when thus treated as the practical employment of the never-ending
regress in the series of empirical conditions, time. Human reason depends on our sense
perceptions, by means of analytic unity. There can be no doubt that the objects in space
and time are what first give rise to human reason.
Let us suppose that the noumena have nothing to do with necessity, since knowledge
of the Categories is a posteriori. Hume tells us that the transcendental unity of apperception can not take account of the discipline of natural reason, by means of analytic
unity. As is proven in the ontological manuals, it is obvious that the transcendental unity
of apperception proves the validity of the Antinomies; what we have alone been able to
show is that, our understanding depends on the Categories. It remains a mystery why
the Ideal stands in need of reason. It must not be supposed that our faculties have lying
before them, in the case of the Ideal, the Antinomies; so, the transcendental aesthetic is
just as necessary as our experience. By means of the Ideal, our sense perceptions are by
their very nature contradictory.
