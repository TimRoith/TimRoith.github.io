title:  "CBXPy: A python package for consensus-based optimization"
categories: paper
---

I'm very happy to announce that our paper on the CBXPy package has been published in the journal of open source software and can be found [here](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06611).

Together with Rafael Bailo, Alethea Barbaro, Susana N. Gomes 3, Konstantin Riedl,Claudia Totzeck, and Urbain Vaes we designed and implemented a framework to easily employ consensus-based optimization (CBO) methods in Python and Julia. The package is available on [GitHub](https://pdips.github.io/CBXpy/).
