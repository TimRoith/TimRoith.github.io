title:  "Consensus-based optimization for closed-box adversarial attacks and a connection to evolution strategies"
categories: paper

Together with Leon Bungert and Philipp Wacker we uploaded a paper to arXiv, which shows how CBO can be used to create closed-box adversarial attacks. Beyond that we establish an interesting connection between CBO and evolution strategies. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24048).
