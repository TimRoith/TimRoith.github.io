I am very happy to join the hackathon ["Math Meets Image"](https://mathplus.de/topic-development-lab/tes-winter-2021-22/hackathon/) in Berlin. It takes place from 17th to 19th March 2022 at [The Classroom](https://www.fabrik23.com/de/the-classroom/) and is part of [MATH+ Thematic Einstein Semester on "Mathematics of Imaging in Real-World Challenges"](https://mathplus.de/).
