title:  "Dynamics and Discretization: PDEs, Sampling, and Optimization"
---

Looking forward to join the workshop [Dynamics and Discretization: PDEs, Sampling, and Optimization](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/gmos2021-2) at the Simons Institute in Berkeley.

Our work on [convergence rates of Lipschitz learning](/paper/2021/11/25/UCR.html) will be presented there.
